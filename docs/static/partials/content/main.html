<!-- [1. Overview] -->
<div class="page-header">
  <h1 id="ch_overview">Overview</h1>
  <p>Here's a brief overview of the things you can do with Dada. All of these are written from what we consider a best-practices perspective—we'll try to explain along the way why we made certain design choices and how you can improve on your development practices.</p>
</div>
<!-- [1.1 Design philosophy] -->
<h2 id="ch_design_philosophy">Design philosophy</h2>
<p>Dada Framework is being developed as a comprehensive and complete HTML5-capable CSS framework for all types of websites. It's specifically designed to benefit websites with a lot of semantic information and has responsiveness built in.</p>
<p>The core of the framework is a 12-column grid system that can be used to quickly scaffold basic layouts. It's fully responsive and allows you to set specific column structures per responsive target layout, and can be used in liquid (percentage-based container width) form as well for building web apps.</p>
<p>We've tried to ensure that all basic HTML tags, typography elements and components have a consistent style. Helvetica is used as the main font, with Helvetica Neue for interface elements due to its more consistent baseline.</p>
<!-- [1.2 The border-box formatting model] -->
<h2>The <code>border-box</code> formatting model</h2>
<p>One of the basic things the framework does is set the <code>box-sizing: border-box</code> CSS to the entire document. The <code>border-box</code> formatting model changes the basic width and height calculations of HTML elements such that the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> values determine their size, and additional padding and borders exist inside of those value rather than outside. This makes it significantly easier to quickly develop layouts and cuts down on the amount of required markup.</p>
<p>Since the framework's grid system is built using this model as well, it's easily possible to make quick modifications to the grid or the gutter without requiring a recompilation of the framework or additional markup.</p>
<!-- [1.3 Usage of HTML5 elements] -->
<h2>Usage of HTML5 elements</h2>
<p>We recommend the use of an HTML5 doctype with a <code>lang</code> attribute. All modern browsers support HTML5, although not all of its features are necessarily supported yet. All things considered, however, there's no reason not to use the HTML5 doctype anymore.</p>
<pre><span class="cp">&lt;!doctype html&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;html</span> <span class="na">lang=</span><span class="s">"en"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
...
<span class="nt">&lt;/html&gt;</span></pre>
<p>However, if you're supporting a legacy website or application, you can still use the older HTML4 or XHTML doctypes—the framework is agnostic to it. All of the framework's examples are written using XHTML syntax, so they can safely be copypasted into either flavor of markup.</p>
<p>If you're using a language that reads from right to left, such as Arabic, you'll need to include <code>dir="rtl"</code> to the HTML tag.</p>
<!-- [1.4 Basic <head> settings] -->
<h2>Basic <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> settings</h2>
<p>At the very least, you should include the following elements in your <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element:</p>
<pre><span class="nt">&lt;meta</span> <span class="na">charset=</span><span class="s">"utf-8"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;title&gt;</span> ... <span class="nt">&lt;/title&gt;</span></pre>
<p>add some more text here</p>
<!-- [1.5 Browser support] -->
<h2>Browser support</h2>
<p>Dada Framework is fully supported out of the box by all major browsers, except IE8—despite Microsoft's claims to the contrary, the world's most popular browser still garbage. Thankfully, you can easily fix most problems by adding <a href="https://github.com/aFarkas/html5shiv">html5shiv</a> and <a href="https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond">Respond.js</a> to your header code.</p>
<pre>&lt;!-- Enable responsiveness for IE8 and below --&gt;
&lt;!--[if lt IE 9]&gt;
&lt;script src="https://oss.maxcdn.com/libs/html5shiv/3.7.0/html5shiv.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="https://oss.maxcdn.com/libs/respond.js/1.4.2/respond.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;![endif]--&gt;</pre>
<p>These tags should be added after any <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tags. Despite this addition, IE8 will still have no CSS3 effects such as box shadows and rounded corners.</p>
<!-- [1.6 Mobile/responsiveness support] -->
<h2>Mobile/responsiveness support</h2>
<p>We support responsiveness by default. There are four stages of responsiveness, with the smallest being specially designed for mobile phone screen sizes. You can make sections appear for specific sizes only and modify specific column widths where desired. Generally, though, even if you scaffold your grid only for the default or largest size, it should work decently enough on smaller devices.</p>
<p>For properly enabling touch zooming on mobile devices, the following element should be added.</p>
<pre><span class="nt">&lt;meta</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">"viewport"</span> <span class="na">content=</span><span class="s">"width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1"</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span></pre>
<p>If you're developing a web-based application or site that should not zoom at all, you can disable it entirely.</p>
<pre><span class="nt">&lt;meta</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">"viewport"</span> <span class="na">content=</span><span class="s">"width=device-width, user-scalable=no, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span></pre>
